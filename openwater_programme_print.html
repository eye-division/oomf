      Commencing near <strong>The Trout Inn</strong> at Wolvercote the Lord Lieutenant will embark in the <strong>'Royal Thamesis</strong>',a reconstruction of Queen Mary's Royal Barge. Following a living<br />
      tradition, he and his party will progress along the Thames through the city to Iffley Lock and then up the Cherwell River to the Christ Church landing stage. The 'Royal Thamesis' is a reconstruction of the shallop built for Queen Mary in 1689, of the finest English Oak, which can be seen to this day in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich. The original barge transported royal visitors to Henley Regatta as late as 1912, and again to the 1919 Peace Regatta. That barge lasted in service 230 years. The journey can be viewed from the banks of the rivers and will make the following stops (timings approximate): <strong>Wolvercote</strong> (near the Trout Inn) 9:00am, <strong>Medley Sailing Club</strong>: 9:30am, <strong>Osney Lock</strong> 10:05am, <strong>Donnington Bridge</strong> 11:00am, <strong>Christ Church</strong> landing stage (nr ferry) 11:35am.<br />

        <strong>Should We Blame 'Global Warming For An Increased Risk of Flooding in South<br />
        East England?</strong> Whenever apparently unusual weather events happen, from floods in winter to heat-waves in summer, many people ask whether emissions of greenhouse gases due to human activity, or &quot;anthropogenic climate change&quot; is somehow to blame. <strong>Dr Myles Allen</strong>, a Lecturer in the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford will explain how this will never be a completely straightforward question to answer, because of the chaotic, unpredictable nature of weather. However, he will make increasingly specific statements about how the risks of such events may be changing due to human activity, and he will show some results from recent climate modelling experiments and explain how anyone with a personal computer can join in to help understand the climate system better.

Which flood put out railway engine fires at Kennington?<br />
      Where are high floods commemorated? And are the city's floods getting worse, or are its residents living ever closer to its rivers? Frank will describe sources for a flood chronology from 1223; The talk will be followed by an opportunity for questions and discussion.

Boats from all over Oxfordshire and beyond will join the procession led by the two festival boats which have journeyed through the county from Cropredy along the Oxford Canal and from Henley along the River Thames.<br />
        Community participants will join in the boat procession on the boats and along the riverside displaying processional sails and water images and costumes made in workshops around the county and musicians will play on the boats and on the riverbanks. The procession starts at the Sandford Lock end of the river. The towpath on the Oxford Preservation Trust land at Kennington runs along the river and open pasture from Sandford Lock. For those happy to rub shoulders with cattle and sheep it's a good place to observe activity on the river as the procession starts.<br />
        The procession then moves to the Isis between Iffley Lock and Folly Bridge for the afternoon.<br />
